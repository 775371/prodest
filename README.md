# prodest

Stata and R packages for Production Function Estimation. 

`prodest` in Stata ([Mollisi et al., 2017](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2916753)) is available on the SSC archive - type `ssc install prodest` to install the latest stable version.

`prodest` in R ([Rovigatti, 2017](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=prodest)) is available on the CRAN -  type `install.packages("prodest")` to install the latest stable version. 

The packages implement most of the methods for production function estimation. The R prodest package provides functions to estimate the productivity, state and free variables parameters. Full description of the models, their issues and characteristics is available on both the packages' documentation and the relative working papers.
